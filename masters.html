							<h1>Holistic Hybrid Mobile Manipulator Control</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>This letter details the design of a reactive hybrid mobile manipulator based on the implementation of 
								<a href="modular_mobile_manipulator.html">Design and Implementation of a Mobile Manipulator MQP.</a>
								This work is heavily based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04749">A Holistic Approach to Reactive Mobile Manipulation by Haviland et al.</a>
								Their approach to treating the mobile base and robot arm as a single system in a motion controller enabled smooth/graceful motion that achieves a desired end effector pose and avoids joint position/velocity limits 
								while maximizing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02783649850040020"> Yoshikawa's Manipulability index.</a>
								This project expands their work by incorporating three additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) in a parallel manipulator elevator between 
								the mobile base and the robotic arm to create a 12-DOF system. We demonstrate and compare various implementation methods to incorporate the elevator through simulation in ROS1/ Gazebo. 
								Additionally, we discuss the homogenous Power Manipulability as a promising alternative manipulability index to restructure the motion controller algorithm.</p>

							<h2>What is a Mobile Manipulator?</h2>
							<p>A Mobile Manipulator can be defined as a robot arm (a manipulator) attached to a mobile base. 
								These systems are usually extremely redudent by having many Degrees of Freedom (DOFs). 
								Our system has 12/13 DOFs depending on the desired configuration.</p>

							</div>
							<p>A Mobile Manipulator is a highly valuable asset to researchers and manufacturers. 
								A traditional robot arm is constrained to a workspace limited by joint limits, link lengths, and self collision. 
								A Mobile Manipulator allows this workspace to travel which enables significantly more possibilties such as long distance pick and place, rescue operations, bomb defusing, etc.</p>
							

							<h2>Holistic Control</h2>
							<p>With a Mobile Manipulator system it became imperative to find a method to control the system to achieve basic goals such as pick and place. 
								We simulate the mobile robot to ensure the controller will not produce motion that could damage the robot arms in the real world. </p>

							</div>
							<p>This simulation is based heavily off Holistic Mobile Manipulation, developed by Jesse Haviland, Niko Sünderhauf, and Peter Corke. 
							We extend their research through additional redudency in a 3 degree of freedom (DOF) parallel manipulator elevator. 
							We simplify the elevator as a serial linkage consisting of a prismatic joint and two revolute joints.</p>

							<h2>Control Derivation</h2>

							<p>A Quadratic Program (QP) has the form</p>
							<!--QP Definition-->
                            <p>$$\begin{alignat}{3} 
								\underset{x}{\text{minimize$:$}} &\quad& f_0(x) &= \frac{1}{2}x^\top{}Px + q^\top{}x \\
								\text{subject to$:$}             &\quad& Gx &\le h \\
																 &\quad& Ax &= b  
							\end{alignat}$$</p>
							<p>Where  \(x\) is the optimization variable, \(f_0(x)\) is the optimization cost function, and the subject to equations are constraints put on the cost function.
								For the cost function to have a global minimum, matrix \(P\) must be positive definite. It is desirable to turn a QP into some form that a serial robot arm
								can utilize. 
							</p>
							<h2>Manipulator Kinematics Refresher</h2>
							<p>I will not be going into significant detail regarding the derivation of joint space and task space for manipulators as there is a wealth of information online
								detailing this process. For now, we assume there is a function \(F(q)\) that can map the joint space parameters to task space \(P\). We write this relationship as:
								$$P=F(q)$$
								Where \(P\) is the end effector location in task space, and \(q\) are the joint angles of the manipulator arm. This relationship can be expanded by taking the time derivative.
								$$\frac{\text{d}P}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}F(q)}{\text{d}t} \Longrightarrow v = J(q)\dot{q}$$
								Where \(v\) is what's known as the Spatial Velocity. Using this relationship, we are able to determine the linear and angular velocites of the end effector knowing only the
								current joint angles, the current joint angular velocities, and the linkage lengths. We can now make a Resolved Rate Motion Controller by introducing the idea of error- where the end 
								effector currently is compared against where we want it to be. 
								$$e(q) = P^*-P(q)$$
								Here, \(P^*\) is the desired task space end effector pose and \(P\) is the current pose. Now, if we reorganize our Spacial Velocity equation to solve for angular joint velocites, the 
								equation becomes \(\dot{q} = J^\top{}v\). Let's enable error to be a factor by making \(v\) proportional to \(e\). This will cause the robot arm to be pulled in the direction of 
								desired pose. It's velocity will decay as it approaches the goal. </p>
								<!-- <br/><br/> -->
							<h2>RRMC into QP</h2>
							<p>
							Taking the idea of the RRMC, we can get the exact same result by reorganizing it into a QP. 
							<!--RRMC as QP-->
							$$\begin{alignat}{3} 
								\underset{\dot{q}}{\text{minimize$:$}} &\quad& f_0(\dot{q}) &= \frac{1}{2}\dot{q}^\top{}1_n\dot{q} \\
								\text{subject to$:$}             &\quad& J(q)\dot{q} &= v \\
																	&\quad& \dot{q}^- &\le \dot{q} \le \dot{q}^+  
							\end{alignat}$$

							<h2>Introduction to Manipulability</h2>
							<p>
								When a robotic arm has more than 6 DOFs it is known as <i>kinematically redundant</i>. In this vein, the arm is now capable of an envelope of valid solutions for reaching a desired end-effector
								pose. We call this region the null-space. If there are an infinite number of valid configurations within an envelope this begs the question of how to determine what configurations are best.
								In 1985, Tsuneo Yoshikawa published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02783649850040020"> Manipulability of Robotic Mechanisms</a> outlining a mathematical basis for evaluting 'better' 
								configurations with a manipulability metric. Thereafter, many different manipulability metrics were developed but Yoshikawa Manipulability remains popular due to its longstanding prominance in literature
								and well understood mechanics.

								</div>
								<p style="text-align: center;">Different configurations for reaching the same pose. The Yoshikawa Manipulability is calculated in real-time and printed above the end-effector</p>
							</div>
							
							<p>
							Looking in the above example, what configuration is best for the arm? It's easy to say the one where the arm is in the least 'wonky' position but what does this mean? Yoshikawa developed 
							a manipulability ellipsoid to help answer this question. The volume of the ellipsoid, the Yoshikawa Manipulability metric, is defined as the following:</p>

							<!--Manipulability metric-->
                            <p>\[m(q)=\sqrt{\det({\hat{J}(q)\hat{J}(q)^\top{}})}\]</p>
							
							<p>
							Here, \(\hat{J}\) is only the linear or angular part of the Jacobian. Since the linear and angular parts contain different units (m/s or rad/s), the metric becomes ambigious when the Jacobian is not
							seperated. Typically, the Yoshikawa Manipulability utilizes the linear component of the Jacobian. </p>

							
							<p>
							It's helpful to visualize the ellipsoid for different robotic configurations to gain an intuition to what Yoshikawa Manipulability definition means.</p>

							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-1"><span class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/MS/manipulability.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="col-1"><span class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></span></div>
									<!-- <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/MQP/elevator render.gif" alt="" /></span></div> -->
								</div>
							</div>
							
							<p>Look at the poorly conditioned manipulator- the arm cannot extend further out but it can swing side to side. The prinicipal axes of the ellipsoid reflect this relationship as the lateral axis is long,
							demonstrating the arm, in its current configuration, can quickly move side to side. However, the arm cannot extend out much further as it's already quite extended so the other axis of the ellipsoid 
							in this direction is very small. This means that the volume of the ellipsoid would be small as well. The well conditioned manipulator, however, is able to move in any direction in about the same speed
							in its current configuration. This makes the manipulability ellipsoid look more spherical and, thus, have a larger volume. </p>

							<p>
								It's ideal to have the arm in a well conditioned configuration to help it handle any problems it may encounter. For example, a person could be injured with the arm in poor configuration as the arm
								could not move out of the way fast enough. Further, when lifting heavy objects the poor configuration will have a much larger level arm which can damage the electronics from the stress. Simply put,
								if the arm is in a good standing configuration it can employ an apprioriate response that it otherwise may not be able to do in a poorly conditioned configuration.
							</p>
							<p>
								To answer the previously asked question <i>which configuration is best for a given end-effector pose</i>, look back to the gif. Notice that the manipulability is highest when the arm has 
								mostly right angles. This is entirely intentional as right angles keep the arm together and not extended. Further, this position is usually around the middle ground of each actuators physical limits,
								allowing it to turn either counter clockwise or clockwise with ease. 
							</p>
							
							<h2>Manipulability and Null Space</h2>
							<p>
								Let us see what happens when we take the time derivative of manipulability.
								
								$$\begin{alignat}{2} 
									\frac{\text{d} \ m(t)}{\text{d}t} &= \frac{1}{2m(t)}\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\text{det}(\hat{J}(q)\hat{J}(q)^\top) \\
									\dot{m} &= J_{m}^\top{}(q)\dot{q}
								\end{alignat}$$
								Where
								
								$$\begin{alignat}{1} 
									J_m^\top{} = m \begin{bmatrix} 
												\text{vec}\Big(\hat{J}(q)\hat{H_1}(q)^\top{}\Big)^\top{}\text{vec}\Big((\hat{J}(q)\hat{J}(q)^\top{})^{-1}\Big) \\
												\text{vec}\Big(\hat{J}(q)\hat{H_2}(q)^\top{}\Big)^\top{}\text{vec}\Big((\hat{J}(q)\hat{J}(q)^\top{})^{-1}\Big) \\
												\vdots{} \\
												\text{vec}\Big(\hat{J}(q)\hat{H_n}(q)^\top{}\Big)^\top{}\text{vec}\Big((\hat{J}(q)\hat{J}(q)^\top{})^{-1}\Big) \\
									\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^n
								\end{alignat}$$
								\(J_m^\top{}\) is the manipulability Jacobian, \(\text{vec}(\cdot)\) is a vector operation to convert a matrix column-wise into a column vector (\(\mathbb{R}^{a\times{}b} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{ab}\)),
								and \(\hat{H_i}\) is the translational or rotational component of \(H_i\) which is the \(i^{th}\) component of the manipulator Hessian tensor \(H\).

							</p>
							<p>
								A kinematically redundant manipulator has null space, as we explored above. However, we can augment our spatial velocity equation (\(v = J(q)\dot{q}\)) by restricting \(v=0\) to result
								in no end effector motion. We can project \(q_{null}\) onto the null space to maintain the 0 spatial velocity objective. The equation now takes the form:
								$$\begin{alignat}{1} 
									\dot{q} = J(q)^+v + \big(1_n-J(q)^+J(q)\big)\dot{q}_{null}
								\end{alignat}$$

								Here, the symbol \(\dot{q}_{null}\) represents the desired joint velocities specifically intended for the null-space motion. This notation indicates the target or planned velocities for 
								the robot's joints when executing tasks within the null space, which is a subspace orthogonal to the primary task space.			
								Park suggested utilizing the Yoshikawa manipulability metric gradient as \(\dot{q}_{null}\)​. This configuration would push the robot configuration into higher manipulability orientations
								without hindering the primary task objective. The final equation takes the form:
								$$\begin{alignat}{1} 
									\dot{q} = J(q)^+v + \frac{1}{\lambda}\big(1_n-J(q)^+J(q)J_m(q)\big)
								\end{alignat}$$
								
								Where \(\lambda\) is a scalar gain to scale the enforcment of the manipulability maximization influence. We can import this equation into a Quadratic Program problem.   
							</p>
							<h3>Park's Manipulability Equation as a QP</h3>
							We reorganize Parks equation into a QP cost function to find the minimum joint-velocity norm needed to achieved the desired end-effector velocity. 
							<p>
								$$\begin{alignat}{2} 
									\underset{\dot{q}}{\text{minimize$:$}} &\quad& f_0(\dot{q}) &= \frac{1}{2}\dot{q}^\top{}\lambda 1_n\dot{q} - J_{m}^\top(q)\dot{q} \\
									\text{subject to$:$}             &\quad& J(q)\dot{q} &= v \\

								\end{alignat}$$
							Building off this concept can expand the QP to incorporate a mobile base and enforce other conditions such as velocity and positional joint limits. 
							</p>
